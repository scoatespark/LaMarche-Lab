    <h3>Chang Zhang Ph.D</h3>
    <p>Chang received his PhD in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in 2020 from Shanghai Institute for Biological Science, Chinese Academy of Science (CAS) where I was focusing on the splicing factor‚Äôs role in liver cancer. In 2020, I joined the Institute of Neuroscience of CAS to start my postdoctoral training on gene therapy based on CRISPR. In 2022, I joined Dr. M√ºschen lab at Yale and investigated the mitochondrial fission/fusion in B cell development and B-cell malignancies. In 2024, I started to work with Dr. LaMarche at Yale on the project of IL18‚Äôs functions in controlling non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). I am interested in how the distinctive immune microenvironment regulates tumorigenesis and in translating laboratory discoveries into clinical therapies.

I love Chinese calligraphy and music. I also cherish my family, my wife and our two lovely daughters. At home, they‚Äôre all my bosses.</p>

    <p>
      Sasha is a graduate student whose research focuses on the interplay between the nervous and immune systems in regulating metastatic progression. 
      She is especially interested in uncovering the mechanisms that drive or suppress brain metastases. 
      In her free time you can find her traveling, hiking, climbing, hanging out with her pets, building something, or abandoning yet another hobby.

    <h3>IV and Nikki</h3>
    <p>IV (left), named for the spots that run down his back and spell out "IV" in Morse code, short for IV Shr√∂dinger League, adopted during Sasha's quantum chemistry era. Nikki (right), short for Snickers or Nikita (depending on why her government name is being used), survived a few hours in the wild before being rescued against her will, she takes this personally. In their free time they run circles around the apartment and dissociate with an empty head.  </p>
