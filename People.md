    <h3>Chang Zhang Ph.D</h3>
    <p>Chang received his PhD in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in 2020 from Shanghai Institute for Biological Science, Chinese Academy of Science (CAS), where he was focusing on the splicing factor‚Äôs role in liver cancer. In 2020, he joined the Institute of Neuroscience of CAS to start his postdoctoral training on gene therapy based on CRISPR. In 2022, Chang joined Dr. M√ºschen's lab at Yale and investigated mitochondrial fission/fusion in B-cell development and B-cell malignancies. In 2024, he began his work with Dr. LaMarche at Yale, where he is currently working on uncovering IL18's role in controlling non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He is also interested in how the distinctive immune microenvironment regulates tumorigenesis and in translating laboratory discoveries into clinical therapies. <br><br>
Chang loves Chinese calligraphy and music. He also cherishes his family, his wife, and their two lovely daughters. At home, they‚Äôre all his bosses.<br>Email him at <a href="mailto:chang.zhang@yale.edu">chang.zhang@yale.edu</a>.</p>

    <h3>Sasha Coates‚ÄìPark</h3>
    <p>
      Sasha is a graduate student whose research focuses on the interplay between the nervous and immune systems in regulating metastatic progression. 
      She is especially interested in uncovering the mechanisms that drive or suppress brain metastases. 
      In her free time you can find her traveling, hiking, climbing, hanging out with her pets, building something, or abandoning yet another hobby. 
      Email her at <a href="mailto:sasha.coates-park@yale.edu">sasha.coates-park@yale.edu</a>.

    <h3>Jake Fontaine</h3>
    <p>Jake graduate student who joined the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 2022. As a member of the LaMarche lab, his current research is focused on how solid tumors disrupt haematopoiesis, and how NK cells regulate development of immune cells though targeted cytotoxicity. He is also interested in elucidating how lung tumors impact B cell-mediated antitumor immunity through chronic IL-4 signaling and disrupted crosstalk with myeloid cells. When he is not in lab, he enjoys PC gaming (shoutout to BG3 and Expedition 33) and tabletop games, like D&D and Catan. Email him at <a href="mailto:jake.fontaine@yale.edu">jake.fontaine@yale.edu</a>.

    <p>Bean (right) survived a housefire, was abandoned, and then rescued from a roof in Maryland. Pinto (left) was picked out of a gutter in Puerto Rico. Bean is the peace to Pinto's chaos; even with a six-year age gap, they are best friends.</p>

    <h3>IV and Nikki</h3>
    <p>IV (left), named for the spots that run down his back and spell out "IV" in Morse code, short for IV Shr√∂dinger League, adopted during Sasha's quantum chemistry era. Nikki (right), short for Snickers or Nikita (depending on why her government name is being used), survived a few hours in the wild before being rescued against her will, she takes this personally. In their free time they run circles around the apartment and dissociate with an empty head.  </p>
