# Welcome to the LaMarche Lab

We are a cancer immunology lab in the Department of Pathology and the Yale Cancer Biology Institute. Working closely with both physicians and basic scientists, we combine high-dimensional profiling of cancer patient tissues with detailed mechanistic studies in mouse models to develop new immunotherapies for solid tumors.
